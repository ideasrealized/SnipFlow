# SnipFlow

**Intelligent text productivity engine that revolutionizes how people work with repetitive text through dynamic snippets and AI-powered automation.**

## Overview

SnipFlow goes beyond traditional text expanders by introducing "chains" - branching text workflows that adapt to different scenarios, presenting users with contextual options and custom inputs at insertion time. Think of it as having a smart assistant that not only remembers your common text patterns but understands when and how to use them based on your current context.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Chains**: Branching text workflows that adapt to different scenarios
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Context-aware text generation and optimization
- **Cross-Platform Desktop App**: Works across all your programs
- **Local-First Privacy**: Local storage with optional AI features
- **Edge-Activated Overlays**: Lightning-fast access with customizable hotkeys
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Intelligent tracking and suggestions
- **Predictive Text**: AI-driven context suggestions
