# Three-Point Verification Protocol

The Three-Point Verification Protocol is a systematic approach to ensure robust and error-free software modifications. It emphasizes the importance of thorough verification at each step of the change process, reducing the risk of introducing new bugs or regressions.

## Protocol Steps

### 1. **Connections Verification**
- **Upstream**: Verify that your changes do not inadvertently affect upstream components. Ensure that any components or modules that provide inputs to your changes are considered and tested.
- **Downstream**: Check that downstream components which depend on the modified functionality are still working correctly. This includes APIs, UI components, and other integrations.
- **Bidirectional**: Ensure data flow integrity between connected components. Confirm that events or data are properly sent and received, maintaining overall application integrity.

### 2. **Functions Verification**
- **Functionality**: Check for accurate implementation of new or modified functions. Ensure functions perform as expected without errors.
- **Duplication**: Avoid duplicate code or unnecessary complexity. Make sure the functionality exists uniquely within the system.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure new code integrates well with existing code. Conformance to existing patterns and standards is essential for maintainability.

### 3. **Verification of Execution**
- **Compilation and Testing**: Verify that changes pass all compilation checks and unit tests. Run integration tests if the changes impact multiple components.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ensure the changes do not negatively impact performance or user experience. Conduct performance testing if necessary.
- **Structure and Organization**: Review code structure to confirm adherence to project guidelines and standards. This includes proper naming conventions, file organization, and documentation.

## Best Practices
- Maintain detailed documentation of changes for future reference.
- Conduct peer reviews to catch potential issues early.
- Iterate on this protocol as necessary to fit the unique needs of your project.

## Use Case
The Three-Point Verification Protocol is ideal for teams aiming for high code quality and reliability, especially during rapid development cycles. By diligently applying this protocol, the risk of introducing critical bugs can be minimized.

**Note**: This protocol is a starting point and can be adapted to specific project requirements.
