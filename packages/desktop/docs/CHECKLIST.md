# SnipFlow Checklist for Consistency and Stability

## 1. Consistent Styling with Tailwind CSS:
- [x] Ensure all components import Tailwind CSS.
  - [x] Check all entries in the build output.
  - [x] Both global.css and globals.css are properly imported in index.tsx
- [x] Convert or remove inline styles in favor of Tailwind classes.
  - [x] SettingsView.tsx (partially completed)
  - [x] SettingsViewNew.tsx (completed)
  - [ ] Other components
- [ ] Review component styles for conflicts and standardize.
  - [ ] Document any style customizations globally.

## 2. TypeScript Consistency:
- [x] Ensure all components and functions use type annotations.
  - [x] Avoid using `any` type unless justified.
    - [x] Fixed SettingsViewNew.tsx to eliminate `any` usage
    - [x] Fixed SnippetManagerView.tsx to eliminate `any` usage
    - [x] Fixed ClipboardManagerView.tsx to eliminate `any` usage
    - [x] Fixed types.ts GenericApi to use `unknown` instead of `any`
    - [x] Fixed types.ts EventsApi to use `unknown` instead of `any`
- [x] Define common types and interfaces for strong typing.
  - [x] All types are centralized in types.ts

## 3. Event Handling Standardization:
- [x] Use consistent IPC patterns for Electron main and renderer communication.
  - [x] Clipboard monitoring properly started and stopped
  - [x] All IPC handlers properly set up in main.ts
  - [ ] Validate IPC messages rigorously.
  - [ ] Clean up any unused listeners to prevent memory leaks.

## 4. React Component Best Practices:
- [x] Convert all React components to functional components using hooks.
  - All components already use functional components
- [x] Optimize components using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - [x] ChainCard.tsx optimized with React.memo
  - [x] Sidebar.tsx optimized with React.memo
  - [x] Modal.tsx optimized with React.memo
  - [x] ChainOptionItem.tsx optimized with React.memo
  - [x] CollapsibleSection.tsx optimized with React.memo
  - [x] Use useEffect and useMemo judiciously.
    - [x] ClipboardManagerView optimized with useMemo for filtering pinned/recent items
    - [x] ClipboardManagerView optimized with useCallback for event handlers

## 5. Performance Optimization:
- [x] Implement lazy loading for components using React.lazy and Suspense.
  - [x] App.tsx now uses lazy loading for all view components
- [ ] Optimize transitions and animations for smoothness using CSS transitions.

## 6. CI/CD Integration:
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.

## 7. Development Guidelines:
- [ ] Define clear project coding standards and adhere to best practices.
- [ ] Regularly document and review updates to dependencies.

## 8. Chain Manager UI Enhancements:
- [ ] Redesign the Chain Manager to use a mind map style layout.
  - [ ] Use libraries like d3.js or cytoscape.js.
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary scrolling by organizing items logically.
  - [ ] Group related components together visually.

## 9. Workflow and Visual Improvements:
- [ ] Ensure visual fidelity across different screen sizes and themes.
- [ ] Add customization tools for users to personalize the app.
- [ ] Streamline user workflows by reducing steps needed for common tasks.
- [ ] Make UI elements intuitive and accessible.

## 10. Future Development:
- [ ] Plan for integrating AI-driven features, like contextual suggestions.
- [ ] Explore mobile compatibility with React Native.
- [ ] Consider API integration for cloud services.
