# 🔗 SnipChain Feature Explanation & Technical Guide

## Overview

SnipChain is the revolutionary core feature of SnipFlow that transforms repetitive text communication into a series of simple clicks. It creates branching, decision-based text workflows that allow users to build complete, professional responses by clicking through options rather than typing.

## 🎯 Core Concept: "Click-Through Communication"

Instead of typing the same responses repeatedly, users navigate through pre-built conversation paths, selecting appropriate options at each decision point. Each click adds text and presents the next set of choices, creating a complete response in seconds.

## 📚 Key Terminology

- **Chain**: A collection of related text options that form a workflow
- **Node**: A single option within a chain (text snippet with potential branches)
- **Chain Trigger**: The `[Chain:ChainName]` syntax that activates a chain
- **Terminal Node**: A final option that completes the chain
- **Custom Field**: The `[?:FieldName]` syntax for user-specific input

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Basic Flow Example

```
User Action                           System Response
-----------                           ---------------
1. Type/Insert snippet               → "Hello, this is Sarah. [Chain:Response]"
2. System detects [Chain:Response]   → Shows overlay with response options
3. Click "Technical Issue"           → Adds "I can help with that. [Chain:TechSupport]"
4. System detects [Chain:TechSupport]→ Shows tech support options
5. Click "Password Reset"            → Adds "Let me reset your password. [Chain:Signature]"
6. Click "Sarah"                     → Adds "Best regards, Sarah" (Terminal - chain ends)
7. Complete text inserted            → Full professional response ready to send
```

### 2. Real-World Example: Customer Service Chain

**Initial Snippet**: "CustomerGreeting"
```
Hello, this is [?:AgentName] from TechSupport Inc. [Chain:InitialResponse]
```

**Chain: InitialResponse**
- **[Calling About Issue]** → "I see you're calling about a technical issue. [Chain:IssueType]"
- **[Following Up]** → "I'm following up on your previous ticket. [Chain:TicketStatus]"
- **[General Inquiry]** → "How can I assist you today? [Chain:ServiceMenu]"

**Chain: IssueType**
- **[Computer Problem]** → "I'll help you with your computer. [Chain:ComputerIssues]"
- **[Internet Issue]** → "Let's troubleshoot your internet connection. [Chain:InternetSteps]"
- **[Software Bug]** → "I'll help resolve that software issue. [Chain:SoftwareSupport]"

And so on, creating a complete conversation tree.

## 💡 Chain Types & Components

### 1. Simple Text Chains
Basic chains that just insert text without further branching:
```
Chain: Signatures
- [John] → "Best regards,\nJohn Smith\nSenior Support Specialist"
- [Sarah] → "Kind regards,\nSarah Johnson\nCustomer Success Manager"
- [Team] → "Sincerely,\nThe Support Team"
```

### 2. Branching Chains
Chains that lead to other chains, creating complex workflows:
```
Chain: PricingInquiry
- [Budget Option] → "Our starter plan is $29/month. [Chain:BudgetFeatures]"
- [Professional] → "Our professional plan is $99/month. [Chain:ProFeatures]"
- [Enterprise] → "For enterprise pricing, [Chain:EnterpriseContact]"
```

### 3. Custom Input Integration
Chains can include prompts for personalized information:
```
"Thank you for your order, [?:CustomerName]. Your [?:ProductName] will ship to [?:Address] within [Chain:ShippingOptions]"
```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Chain Data Structure
```typescript
interface Chain {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                  // Display name & trigger name
  category: string;              // Organization (e.g., "Support", "Sales")
  nodes: ChainNode[];            // Available options
  usage_count: number;           // Analytics
  last_used: Date;              
  tags: string[];               // For search/filter
}

interface ChainNode {
  id: string;                    // Unique within chain
  title: string;                 // Shows in overlay
  content: string;               // Text to insert
  icon?: string;                 // Visual identifier
  chainTriggers?: string[];      // Detected [Chain:X] references
  customFields?: string[];       // Detected [?:X] references
  isTerminal: boolean;           // Ends chain if true
  metadata?: {
    typical_next?: string[];     // AI suggestions
    avg_selection_time?: number; // Analytics
  };
}
```

### Chain Execution Engine
```typescript
class ChainExecutor {
  private activeChain: Chain | null = null;
  private textBuffer: string[] = [];
  private chainPath: string[] = [];  // Breadcrumb trail
  private context: Map<string, string> = new Map(); // Stored inputs
  
  async executeNode(node: ChainNode): Promise<void> {
    // Add to buffer
    this.textBuffer.push(node.content);
    this.chainPath.push(node.title);
    
    // Parse for chain triggers
    const triggers = this.parseChainTriggers(node.content);
    
    if (triggers.length > 0 && !node.isTerminal) {
      // Load and display next chain
      const nextChain = await this.loadChain(triggers[0]);
      this.showOverlay(nextChain);
    } else {
      // Chain complete
      await this.finalizeChain();
    }
  }
  
  private async finalizeChain(): Promise<void> {
    let finalText = this.textBuffer.join(' ');
    
    // Handle custom fields
    const customFields = this.parseCustomFields(finalText);
    if (customFields.length > 0) {
      finalText = await this.promptForCustomFields(finalText, customFields);
    }
    
    // Insert and cleanup
    await this.insertText(finalText);
    this.reset();
  }
}
```
